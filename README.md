# ai-launcher

One command for all your AI coding agents. Type `ai` to see every agent and account with how much of its plan limit is used, then pick one to start it in the current folder.

- **Every agent in one list.** Claude Code (several accounts), Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, Kimi, OpenCode, Qwen, or any CLI you add.
- **Usage at a glance.** Shows 5-hour and weekly limits with reset times. Bars turn yellow at 60% and red at 90%.
- **Your own launch commands.** Add, edit or delete agents and their commands, from the command line or inside the picker.
- **Trust a folder once.** If any agent trusts the folder, every agent you start through `ai` trusts it too, so they stop asking.
- **No API calls.** Usage comes from files the agents already write on your machine.

Works on macOS, Linux and Windows through WSL. Nothing to install: it's plain bash.

## Install

Nothing to install first. It's plain bash, which is built into macOS, Linux and WSL, and it works from any shell (zsh, bash, fish).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ak1Ena/ai-launcher ~/code/ai-launcher
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/code/ai-launcher/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
```

Open a new terminal and type `ai`.

**Optional extras.** Each one turns on more features. Without them, everything else still works:

| Tool | Adds | Built into |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) | Arrow-key picker with search. Without it you get a numbered menu. | — |
| [jq](https://jqlang.org) | Usage bars and shared folder trust | macOS 15+ |
| tmux | Claude team mode (`ctrl-t`, `cla-team`) | — |

```bash
brew install fzf tmux            # macOS (jq is built in on macOS 15+, else: brew install jq)
sudo apt install fzf jq tmux     # Linux / WSL
```

On Windows, run it inside WSL. Native PowerShell is not supported.

### Show Claude usage

Claude Code passes usage to its status line. To save it, point your status line at the bundled script in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/code/ai-launcher/scripts/statusline-usage.sh" }
```

If you already have a status line command, add it after the script. The script passes the same input on to it:

```json
"statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/code/ai-launcher/scripts/statusline-usage.sh my-statusline --flag" }
```

Usage shows up after your next Claude reply. It is only reported on Pro and Max plans.

## Use it

```bash
ai                 # pick an agent and start it here
ai --resume        # extra arguments go to the agent
```

| With fzf | Without fzf | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enter` | `2` | Start the selected agent |
| `ctrl-t` | `t 2` | Start Claude in team mode (teammates in tmux split panes) |
| `ctrl-a` | `a` | Add an agent |
| `ctrl-e` | `e 2` | Edit the selected agent |
| `ctrl-x` | `x 2` | Delete the selected agent |

### Manage agents

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ai ls` | List agents with their launch command and label |
| `ai add [name] [command] [label]` | Add an agent. It asks for anything you leave out. |
| `ai edit <name> [command] [label]` | Change the command or label. It asks, showing the current value. Press Enter to keep it. |
| `ai rm <name>` | Delete an agent, after asking you to confirm. `ai add <name>` brings it back. |

```bash
ai add aider "aider --model sonnet" "Aider"
ai edit claude "claude --model opus"
```

Agents are saved in `~/.config/ai-launcher/providers`, one per line as `name<TAB>command<TAB>label`. On first run, the file is filled with the agents you have installed. A command runs like a shell alias, so quotes and `VAR=value` prefixes work.

### Several Claude accounts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `cla add work` | Add an account and log in. Settings, skills and plugins are shared with `~/.claude`. |
| `cla` / `cla-team` | Pick a Claude account, then start it normally or in team mode |
| `cla work [team] [args]` | Start a specific account |
| `cla ls`, `cla rm work`, `cla mv work job` | List, remove or rename accounts |

Accounts live in `~/.claude-accounts/<name>`. Set `CLA_ROOT` to use another folder.

## How it works

**Usage.** Nothing is fetched from the internet:
- **Claude:** reads `<account>/usage/usage.json`, written by `scripts/statusline-usage.sh`. The numbers are from that account's last session. Rows older than 10 minutes show their age, and a limit whose reset time has passed shows 0%.
- **Codex:** reads the rate limits saved in the newest `~/.codex/sessions` log.
- **Other agents** don't save usage, so they show "no usage data".

**Folder trust.** When you start an agent through `ai` or `cla`, it checks whether the folder is trusted by any of Claude (main config and every account), Codex, Gemini, Qwen or Antigravity. If one trusts it, the folder is marked trusted in the others too.
- Only that exact folder is shared. Parent folders don't count.
- A folder you marked untrusted in an agent stays untrusted there.

**Staying awake.** On macOS, agents run under `caffeinate -i` so the machine doesn't sleep mid-task.

## Add usage bars for another agent

An agent with no plugin gets a plain row. To show usage, create `plugins/<name>.sh`, where `<name>` is the agent's name in `ai ls`:

```bash
_ai_mytool_rows() {                      # print one picker row per account
  _ai_row mytool <id> <shown-name> "<label>" "$(_ai_bar 5h <percent> '<reset time>')"
}
_ai_mytool_run() { shift; _ai_exec "$(_ai_cmd mytool mytool)" "$@"; }   # optional; $1 = row id
```

To share folder trust with another agent, add its name to `AI_TRUST` and define `_ai_trust_<name>_has` and `_ai_trust_<name>_add` in `lib/trust.sh`.

## Test

```bash
bash tests/check.sh
/bin/bash tests/check.sh     # on macOS: also check with the built-in bash 3.2
```

This runs every feature against a throwaway home folder and never touches your real configs.
